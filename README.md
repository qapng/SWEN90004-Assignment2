For this assignment, we chose to replicate the NetLogo Model Muscle Development in Java and conduct research and observe the effects of different variables on muscle growth. All the Java files in this files are used to run the Simulation. The python files in this file are used to automaticall run the simulation, record the data and graph the results. 
## Running the Java Simulation

1. Run without arguments

```sh
java Main
```
2. Run with ALL 6 arguments

```sh

```
## Running the Python scripts
Run the program with this command
```sh

```
This command will produce graph (.png) in the directory
